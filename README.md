# otp_verification_python
The code provided is a Python script for a simple OTP (One-Time Password) verification application. It uses the Twilio API to send an OTP via SMS to the user's phone number.

The user enters the OTP into a text field in the GUI, and the code validates the OTP. If the OTP is correct, the application displays a "Login Success" message. If the OTP is incorrect or invalid, the application displays a "Wrong OTP" or "Invalid OTP" message, respectively.

The application also includes a "RESEND OTP" button that allows the user to request a new OTP via SMS. An OTP expires after 20 seconds, and a timer is displayed in the GUI to indicate the time remaining until the OTP expires.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for OTP verification in a Python application using the Twilio API.
